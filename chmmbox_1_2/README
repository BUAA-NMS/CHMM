Matlab toolbox for max. aposteriori estimation of two chain 
Coupled Hidden Markov Models. 

(Adapted from Hidden Markov  Toolbox Version 3.3  01-Apr-99 and 
Coupled Hidden Markov Toolbox Version 1.1  01-Feb-01

The software uses some NETLAB routines
(see http://neural-server.aston.ac.uk/netlab/index.html
so you'll need to have NETLAB on your search path

See the file VERSION for what's new in this version.

Only the Gaussian observation models have so far been implemented.

DEMONSTRATIONS:

demgausschmm.m       uses Gaussian observation model on AR features

To extend the CHMM to different observation models add the required
code into cobsinit, obslike and obsupdate.

ROUTINES:
Read the file Contents.m

DATA:
